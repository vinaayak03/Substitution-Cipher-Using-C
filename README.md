This program encrypts messages using a substitution cipher, allowing users to define a key for encryption. It accepts a single command-line argument as the key and prompts for plaintext input. The program substitutes each letter according to the key while preserving case and ignoring non-alphabetical characters. Compile and run the program using a standard C compiler to encrypt your messages.
